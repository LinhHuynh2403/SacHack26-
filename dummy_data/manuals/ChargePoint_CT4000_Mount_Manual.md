### 1. Symptom & Identification

The ChargePoint CT4000 can be installed in two configurations:
1. **Pedestal-mounted (bollard):** The charger mounts on a steel or aluminum pedestal that is anchor-bolted to a concrete pad. This is the most common configuration in parking lots.
2. **Wall-mounted:** The charger mounts directly to a wall surface. Wall-mount installations have no pedestal and no `CP-ERR-TIL` concerns.

**Error `CP-ERR-TIL` ("Tilt Alert")** is generated by the CT4000's internal inclinometer (tilt sensor) when the charger has been displaced from vertical by more than **5 degrees** in any direction. The inclinometer is a MEMS-based sensor on the main control board.

**This is not a routine electrical fault** — it is a physical/structural fault indicating the mounting system has been compromised. Common causes:
- **Vehicle impact:** A vehicle backing into or driving into the charger (most common cause in parking lots)
- **Anchor bolt failure:** Anchor bolts loosened by freeze-thaw cycling, concrete heave, or corrosion
- **Concrete pad deterioration:** Cracking or spalling of the concrete pad around the anchor bolt locations
- **Vandalism:** Deliberate physical force applied to the charger
- **Settlement:** Gradual sinking of the mounting pad over time in areas with unstable soil

**Urgency assessment:**
- If the charger is significantly tilted (visibly leaning), the cables and conduit entering the base may be strained. **De-energize and take the station out of service until the mounting is repaired.**
- If the tilt is minor (charger appears nearly vertical but `CP-ERR-TIL` is active), the sensor may have been tripped by vibration or a minor nudge. Still inspect the mounting — a minor lean can indicate early-stage anchor bolt loosening.
- **A tilted charger that still operates is a liability hazard** — document with photos immediately.

### 2. Safety Precautions

> [!WARNING]
> **Vehicle collision:** If the charger was hit by a vehicle, the cable conduit and wiring inside the pedestal may be damaged. Do NOT energize a charger that has been in a vehicle collision without first inspecting the conduit and wiring inside the pedestal base for crush damage or conductor exposure.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Anchor bolt re-torquing and concrete repair** is structural work. If the concrete pad is cracked through to the anchor bolt locations, do not re-torque the bolts — spalled concrete cannot support torque load. The pad must be repaired before re-anchoring.

**Before any mounting work, de-energize and LOTO the upstream breaker.** Conduit enters through the pedestal base — a tilted pedestal can stress the conduit-to-enclosure connection, creating a shock hazard if energized.

**Tools unique to this work require a trained technician with knowledge of concrete anchoring.** If the concrete pad requires repair or replacement, coordinate with a licensed concrete contractor.

**PPE:** Safety glasses, work gloves (handling anchor hardware), steel-toed boots (if handling the pedestal — it weighs 15-20 kg), hearing protection if using impact tools.

| Measuring tape | 5m minimum | Anchor bolt pattern measurement for replacement |

### 4. Step-by-Step Diagnostic & Repair Procedure

**Step 4.1: Immediate Site Assessment (Before Any Work)**
1. **Photograph everything.** Take photos of:
   - The charger from all four sides showing the tilt angle
   - The base of the pedestal and the surrounding concrete pad
   - Any visible vehicle impact damage (scraped paint, dents, broken components)
   - The anchor bolt locations at the base flange
2. If a vehicle collision is suspected, check the surrounding area for vehicle damage debris, paint transfer, or skid marks that would corroborate a collision event. This documentation is essential for insurance claims and site owner notification.
3. Measure the tilt angle using your digital level placed on the charger housing. Record the angle and direction of tilt.

**Step 4.2: LOTO**
1. Lock out the upstream breaker at the electrical panel feeding this charger.
2. Verify the charger is de-energized (display dark).

**Step 4.3: Inspect the Pedestal Base**
1. Examine the base flange (the steel plate at the bottom of the pedestal that sits on the concrete). Look for:
   - **Bent or cracked base flange** — indicates a significant impact force was applied. A bent flange cannot be re-torqued flat; the pedestal requires replacement.
   - **Loose anchor nuts** — can be felt by trying to move each nut by hand. Any that move freely have lost preload.
   - **Pulled-out anchors** — the anchor bolt may have been pulled partially out of the concrete, visible as a gap between the nut/washer and the concrete surface.
   - **Cracked concrete** around anchor locations — hairline cracks radiating from anchor holes indicate overload of the concrete.
2. Check the conduit fitting where the electrical conduit enters the base of the pedestal. If the pedestal has been tilted, this fitting may have been torqued sideways, cracking the conduit or the fitting body.

**Step 4.4: Anchor Bolt Re-Torque (Minor Loosening)**
1. If the anchor nuts are slightly loose but the concrete shows no cracking and the base flange is undamaged:
2. Clean any debris from around the anchor hardware (wire brush on the concrete surface around each anchor).
3. Apply anti-seize compound to the anchor bolt threads.
4. Use the torque wrench to re-torque each anchor nut to **68 Nm (50 ft-lbs)**. Torque in a cross pattern (not sequential) to load the base flange evenly.
5. After re-torquing, verify with the digital level that the charger is plumb (≤1° tilt in all directions).
6. If the charger cannot be plumbed to ≤1° even with all anchors torqued, the concrete pad has settled unevenly — shim plates or pad repair may be required (consult with the site owner/facilities team).

**Step 4.5: Anchor Replacement (Damaged or Pulled-Out Anchors)**
1. Remove the affected anchor nut and washer. Pull the old anchor bolt out of the hole if it is loose. If the anchor is still torque-tight (the concrete failed, not the anchor), you may need to use an impact wrench to break it free.
2. Clean the hole with compressed air to remove concrete dust.
3. If the hole is undamaged (clean, round, with no cracks), install a new Hilti HUS3 M12 wedge anchor: insert the anchor and drive it to the correct embedment depth (marked on the anchor body) with a rotary hammer and setting tool.
4. Install the washer and nut, and torque to 68 Nm.
5. If the hole is cracked or damaged, drill a new anchor hole at least 100mm from the damaged hole, using the rotary hammer with a 12mm SDS bit. Minimum embedment depth: 80mm. Use epoxy anchors (Hilti HIT-RE 500 or equivalent) if the concrete is thin or heavily reinforced in the original location.

**Step 4.6: Pedestal Replacement (Bent Base Flange or Damaged Pedestal)**
1. Disconnect the conduit from the pedestal base fitting. Cap the conduit to prevent dirt ingress.
2. Remove all anchor bolts.
3. Lift the charger (with the old pedestal attached) off the concrete pad — two-person lift, the assembly weighs 30-40 kg.
4. Install the new pedestal base per the ChargePoint CT4000 installation guide, following the anchor bolt pattern and torque specifications.
5. Reconnect the conduit.

### 5. Verification & Testing

1. After all mechanical work, verify the charger is plumb: ≤1° tilt in all directions using the digital level.
2. Inspect the conduit fitting for any cracks or looseness. Tighten if needed.
3. Remove LOTO. Restore the upstream breaker.
4. Power on the CT4000 and allow it to boot.
5. Verify `CP-ERR-TIL` has cleared from the ChargePoint Operations Portal — the inclinometer should now read within its normal range (≤3°) and the error will self-clear once the charger reboots and verifies level.
6. If `CP-ERR-TIL` persists despite the charger appearing level, navigate to Station Settings → Sensors in the Operations Portal. The inclinometer baseline can be re-calibrated if the sensor's zero point has drifted: click "Recalibrate Tilt Sensor" while the charger is confirmed level.
7. Perform a complete charging session test to verify no electrical issues resulted from the physical damage.
8. Log the repair with full photographic documentation. Note all of the following:
   - Date, time, and station ID
   - Suspected cause (vehicle impact, anchor loosening, etc.)
   - Tilt angle measured before repair
   - Anchor condition (loose vs. failed vs. concrete damage)
   - Repair performed (re-torque, anchor replacement, pedestal replacement)
   - Tilt angle after repair
   - Whether site owner notification and incident report were completed
